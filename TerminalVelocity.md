###Terminal Velocity

If the velocity of an obeject obeys an equation of the form:  
<center></center>![][1]  
According to the solution ![][2], its velocity will approach a constant called terminal velocity.  
Here is an example.  
Let a = 10 and b = 1 and use python to calculate and plot the solution.
